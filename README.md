## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I was struggling with the layout for this one and looked to see if Kevin Powell had anything out there that could help. Of course, he had the exact project. I don't like fallowing along with tutorials, but his use of custom properties actually helped using grid areas stick a little, so I'm glad i looked it up! 


### Continued development

Now that I'm getting the hang of grid I'm going to dive more into using custom properties, as well as adding in some Javascript
